The process of finding the optimal combination of these hyperparameters is known as hyperparameter optimization, and it can have a significant impact on performance.\n","\n","There are several techniques used to find the best hyperparameters for models. <code>Grid Search</code> and <code>Randomized Search</code> are some of them, but Grid Search lacks the ability to adapt its search based on previous evaluations, so it may miss out on fine-tuning opportunities in the search space. Randomized Search is better than Grid Search in exploring the space but still lacks an adaptive mechanism. <code>Bayesian optimization</code>, on the other hand, balances exploration (searching different hyperparameters) and exploitation (focusing on promising areas), making it more likely to find the global optimum with fewer trials.\n","\n","Bayesian optimization builds a probabilistic model of the objective function and selects the next set of hyperparameters based on the model's predictions.
